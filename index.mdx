## About Skillfully HiredNow

HiredNow is Skillfully's AI-powered assessment platform. Candidates complete interactive simulations that evaluate job-relevant skills in realistic scenarios. This API provides read-only access to evaluation results, enabling you to sync candidate performance data into your ATS, data warehouse, or reporting systems.

**How it works**

1. Provisioned HiredNow users create a **Campaign** via the employer dashboard (not via API)
2. Candidates receive invite links and complete simulations on the HiredNow platform
3. You pull results via this API using the campaign ID
