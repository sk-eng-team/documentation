## üîê Authentication

HiredNow APIs use API Key-based authentication.

<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step: Obtain an API Key">
    Contact your Athena project administrator/ HiredNow support to obtain an API key for your environment (staging(dev) or production).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Step: Include API Key in Headers">
    Include your API key in the request header as shown below:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="HTTP">
        ```http
        GET /campaigns HTTP/1.1
        Host: api.hirednow.ai
        Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>
        Content-Type: application/json
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="JSON">
        ```json
        {
          "method": "GET",
          "url": "https://api.hirednow.ai/v1/campaigns",
          "headers": {
            "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>",
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
          }
        }
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    If authentication fails, you‚Äôll receive:

    ```json
        {
          "error": "Unauthorized",
          "message": "Invalid or missing API key."
        }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## ‚ö° Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage and optimal performance, rate limits are applied to all API endpoints.

| **Tier** | **Requests per minute** | **Description**                 |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Default  | 60                      | Standard usage tier             |
| Premium  | 300                     | For higher-traffic integrations |

When the limit is reached, the API responds with:

```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "message": "Try again in 60 seconds."
}
```
