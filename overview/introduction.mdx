## Welcome

This guide provides a comprehensive description of the API, including authentication methods, available endpoints, request and response formats, and recommended integration practices. It is intended to serve as a reference for developers to ensure reliable and efficient integration with the provided services.

## **Prerequisites**

Before you begin:

- Obtain your API key from your Skillfully HiredNow account representative
- Have at least one campaign created in the HiredNow dashboard

## Base URL

All API requests must be directed to the following base URL:

<Tip>
  **Base URL**: https://api.external.hirednow.ai
</Tip>

## Authentication

<Info>
  HiredNow APIs use API Key-based authentication.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Obtain API Credentials">
    Contact your HiredNow account representative to request API access credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Authentication">
    Include your API key in all requests using the `Authorization` header: `  Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>`.

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash cURL
    curl -X GET "https://api.external.hirednow.ai/v1/campaigns" \
              -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
              -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    ```

    
    ```http HTTP
    GET /v1/campaigns HTTP/1.1
    Host: api.external.hirednow.ai/[path]
    Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>
    Content-Type: application/json
    ```

    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### **Typical Integration Pattern**

For near-real-time syncs, poll every 2 minutes using incremental fetching:

1. On first sync: fetch all results with `sort=asc`
2. Store the `order_index` from the last record
3. On subsequent syncs: pass `starting_after=<last_order_index>` to fetch only new results
